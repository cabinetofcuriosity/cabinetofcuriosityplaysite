<h2 id="awesome-animal-pick">Awesome Animal Pick</h2>

<h2 id="animal-family-member">Animal Family Member</h2>

<p>Axolotl’s family is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_salamander">Ambystomatidae</a>. What makes this family special is that “all mole salamanders are oviparous and lay large eggs in clumps in the water” (Wikipedia). They have wide-set eyes yet without true eyelids. Another species within this family is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_salamander">tiger salamander</a>, as shown below.</p>
