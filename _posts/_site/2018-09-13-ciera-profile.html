<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p><strong>Ciera Martinez</strong> is a biologist who spent the last ten years studying the evolution of morphology.  During her PhD she explored how plant form develops and now aims to understand how non-coding DNA defines developmental signals during early fruit fly development. She is a Berkeley Institute of Data Science Fellow where she explores her love of all things data. And really likes fancy microscopes and cats.

<h2 id="awesome-animal-pick">Awesome Animal Pick</h2>

<p>I choose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi">Okapi</a>, because it’s looks like a mix between a two other awesome animals - zebras and giraffes. Also, being an evolutionary biologist I love all organisms considered to be exaples of  “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_fossil">living fossils</a>”</p>

<h2 id="animal-family-member">Animal Family Member</h2>

<p>Okapis are part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffidae">Giraffidae</a> family, and are thus closely related to giraffes! In fact, these two species are the only living members of the family. What’s cool about them are that both giraffes and (male) Okapis have these horn-like protuberances called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicone">ossicones</a>. Female Okapis, on the other hand, are special and have hair whorls!</p>
