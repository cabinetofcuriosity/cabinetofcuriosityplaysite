<p>I love the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonaut_(animal)">Argonaut, or Paper Nautilus!</a>, Paper nautiluses are the only living examples of their family, and are actually octopuses - the only ones with a shell! Their shells are actually egg cases, and they use them to ‘gulp’ air to facilitate flotation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbZePKLDxNk">Here</a> is an awesome video of one with an equally awesome soundtrack!!!</p>

<p>The Paper Nautilus is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautidae">Argonautidae</a> family. This family is interesting because egg cases that have nodes, ribs, and a double keel are characteristic of the Argonauta genus, while all other egg cases that lack these features belong to the other 4 (extinct) genera. Another species in this family was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizuhobaris">Mizuhobaris izumoensis</a>, which was driven to extinction in 1913.</p>
