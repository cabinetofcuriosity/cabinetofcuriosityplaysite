<h2 id="awesome-animal-pick">Awesome Animal Pick</h2>

<p>I choose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphioctopus_marginatus">coconut octopus</a>, because I admire the intelligence and beauty of octopi. The coconut octopus gathered coconut shells and carries them around for shelter! They have also been observed gathering tools like shells for defense and concealment, and are beautiful creatures on top of all that.</p>
